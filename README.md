# Heart Disease Prediction Using Explainable AI (XAI)

This project focuses on building a predictive model for heart disease and employing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret the model's predictions. The objective is to provide accurate predictions while offering insights into the factors contributing to the outcomes.

## Features

1. **Predictive Model**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease.
2. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Implements techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions.
3. **Dataset**: The project uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains various medical and demographic features.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- shap
